=========
what is sudo -i?
=============
Sudo(Superuser do) allows a system administrator to give certailn users(or group of user) the ability to rum domr(or all) commands as root while logging all commnads and arguments

what is Root?
=============
Primary Hierarchy root and root directory of the entire file system hirerachy
1. Each single file and directory starts from the root directory
2. Only root user has the right to write under this directory
3. /root is toot user's home directory, which is not same as /
Linux
========
FSH - File System Hierarchy
=========
The Linux FSH defines the directory structure 

Folder/ Directory

pwd - present working directory

mkdir linux
ls
cd linux-demo

file -creation
================
touch file1

Note :
=====
In side directory you may have 100 files - directories are difined with "blue color"
In side file there no directories - files are defined with "white color"

Delete/Remove directory/folder
=============================
rm -rf dirname
or
rm -r firectory (type - y)

Delete/Remove files
============
rm -f filename

how to create multiple directories
=============================
mkdir d1 d2 d3

How to create parent directories
====================
To create parent directories using the mkdir command pass -p option
suppose the directory path /foo/bar/baz is to created even if /foo/bar directory is not existing 

Permissions and rights(ownership)
===========================
A linux is a Multi-user  Operating system which can be accessed by many user simultaneously.
Hence this raises security conecrns as am going to restrict on the perticular user

2 levels

1. Ownership
2. Pemission

How to change the ownership for file level
========================================
The chown command change ownership of files and directories in a linux filesystem
to change the owner of a files/directory

syntax: chown  <ownername>(shobha)  <filename>(file.txt)

How to change the ownership for group of file
=================================
"chown" command is also used to the chnage group name of a file, like "chgrp" command
chown :shobhs file.txt

file name - file.txt

1.chown ec2-user

-rw-r--r-- 1 
  
-rw-    r--        r-- 1 (file - level)
user    group     others

Group:
=====
chown commands is also used to change group name of a file like, "chgrp" commands

synatx: chown <groupname> <filename>

chown :ec2-user file.txt

To recursively change ownership of directories and their contents
========================

synatx: chown -R root >filename>

mkdir test

 d          -rw-    r--        r-- 1
directory   users   group      others



2.chown -R root filename

-R = To recursively change ownership of directories and their contents

mkdir test
chown -R ec2-user:ec2-user test


How to chnage the Permission
========================
All file system object on Unix-like system have three main types of permissions
read, write and execute access.
permissions are based upon 3 possible class(users, group, others)
user, the usergroup and all system users

syntax: ls -lha

1. r: Read   	=4
2. w: Write	=2
3. x: Execution	=1


Permissions
==============
Read      - r   -  - 4
Write     - w   -  - 2
Execution - x   -  - 1
		   ====
                    7
Synatx: ls -lha

Example
===========
d	rwx		r-x		r-x

dir	(user)		(Group)		(Others)

task:
======

setting 442(rrw) permissions for the file of  file.txt(filename)


rwx		r-x		r-x
 r		r		w

file.txt rrw

chmod 442 file.txt


How to change the permissions & ownership recursively
==============================
to chnage the file access permissions you need to sue the chmod command. it has -R or -recursive option thar chnage files and directories recursively

mkdir dir5
cd dir5
touch file6 file7

dir5 - rwx 

d	rwx		r-x		r-x

dir	(user)		(Group)		(Others)

7	0		0

700 --(user)--(group)--(others)



file2 r r w

r--		r--		w--
 4		4		2
chmod 442 file2

permission with dire - anusha

d(rx) user(rx) group(rx) others

5	5	5 

chmod  -R 555 anusha

if you want give the permissions directory level(you should not entire inside the directory)

- when you needs to see the running process on your linux in real time, you can have top as your tool that.

- top also displayes other info besides the running process 
top 
tasks - shows the numbe of process and their current state
%cpu- show CPU uilizaion details, user process, system process running, system Idle cpu.
KIB Mem- VIRT(Virtual Memroy Size(KiB), the total amount of virtual memory used by the process
RES- Residenet Memory Size
SHR - Shared Memory Size

Swap Memory in Linux:
===================
Swap space in Linux is used when the amount of physical memory (RAM) is full. If the system needs more memory resources and the RAM is full, inactive pages in memory are moved to the swap space.
 While swap space can help machines with a small amount of RAM, it should not be considered a replacement for more RAM.

zombie process in linux:
========================
Zombie processes in Linux are sometimes also referred to as defunct or dead processes.
 They're processes that have completed their execution, but their entries are not removed from the process table.

What is buff cache Linux?
========================
buff/cache is memory used by the Linux kernel buffers and page cache. 
You force clear buff/cache using the 'echo' command but observe it gradually increase again to 85% memory consumption.
 Shutting down the SAP NW application and/or database server. does not show buff/cache release any memory.

===================
Image result for zombie in linux

How to find zombie processes?
D = uninterruptible sleep.
I = idle.
R = running.
S = sleeping.
T = stopped by job control signal.
t = stopped by debugger during trace.
Z = zombie.

Ping commnad
===========
packet internet Groper

ICMP - internet Control Messages
TTL - Time To Live
ping -c2 google.com

c - here "c" represents no.of hops you want as output.
incase we gave 2. hence we arr getting hopeand then its getting exited


vmstat command:
================

vmstat (virtual memory stastics)as a valuable monitoring utility, which also provide information about block IO and CP activity in adition to memory
info about block IO and CPU 

Shortcut File commands
===============

wc -l : Prints the number of lines in a file.(filename)
wc -w : prints the number of words in a file.
wc -c : Displays the count of bytes in a file.
wc -m : prints the count of characters from a file.
wc -L : prints only the length of the longest line in a file.

what is /etc
===========
 This is the nerve center of linux system, its contains all system related configuration files in here or in this sub-directories.
A configuration file isdfines as a local files used to control the operations of a program. 

Software Management
====================
its important role in installaling and configuring the softwares.

2 ways we can approach
1.rpm - Redhat package manager
2.yum - yellow dog update manager - (centos)

Ubuntu - apt-get

RPM:
========
RPM is a package managing system(collection of tools to manage software packages) - ex- git, maven, jenkins, python, java
RPM is powerful software mangement tools for installing, uninstall, verifying, querying and updating software packages.
RPM straight forward program to perform the above s/w management tasks.

synatx:

rpm -qa (where q stands for query, and a stands fo all)

rpm -qa python

installion syntax:
====
rpm -ivh package name


list out of package in linux server
==============
rpm -qa |grep -i python

grep - global regular expression print




yum 
=====
yellow dog update manager

yum install git -y


Repo:
clean
list
Networking:
==============
It is a connection between two or more machines to communicate with ach other

Basic Requirement for Networking are
==================
1. NIC(Network Interface Controller or Card)
2. Media
3. Topology
4. Protocol
5. IP Address

1. NIC(Network Interface Controller or Card)
==================
NIC is sued for network adaptor, LAN Adaptor
2. Media
=========
Media is the medium via which two diff computors NIC card will be connected

CIDR - Class Inter Domain Routing

3. Topology:
==============
topology is the scheme or design in which computer in the n/w will be connected

4. Protocol:
==============
a n/w protovol defines rules & conventions for communication b/w n/w devices

TCP - Transimission control protocol -80
UDP - user datafram protocol - 80
HTTP - Hypertext transfer protocol - 80/8080
HTTPS -Hypertext transfer protocol Service - 443

Networking Commands:
======================
Linux Networking Commands
ifconfig.
ip.
traceroute.
tracepath.
ping.
netstat.
ss.
dig.

Netwprk Configuration & Trouble Shooting
-----------------------
Networking - it is a connection b/w two or more machines to communicate with each other



#/etc/sysconfig/network
======================
is a file which keep the information abot the hostname assigned to the system
if you want to change the hostname permannetly.

#/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/


ls /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/


cat /etc/sysconfig/network:
---------------------

is a file whiich keep the information about the hostname assigned to the system. 
if you want to change the hostname permenently , you need to change the hostname in this file.

checking the IP Address
===========
ifconfig -a

DNS
----
Domain Name spacific

nslookup ipaddress/hostname
nslookup 


What is the difference between sudo and su command?
===================================
The main difference between Su and Sudo is that the Su command can interchange between superuser and root user if executed without prior additional options while the Sudo command provides single root privileges. 
Su demands the password of the root account while Sudo demands the password of the current user account

what is inode in linux?
=======================
What is an inode? By definition, an inode is an index node. It serves as a unique identifier for a specific piece of metadata on a given filesystem. 
Each piece of metadata describes what we think of as a file. That's right, inodes operate on each filesystem, independent of the others

Why is inode used?
===================
Inodes keep track of all the files on a Linux system. Except for the file name and the actual content of the file, inodes save everything else.
 It's like a file-based data structure that holds metadata about all of the files in the system.

what is softlink in linux?
======================
Soft links are similar to shortcuts, and can point to another file or directory in any file system. 
Hard links are also shortcuts for files and folders, but a hard link cannot be created for a folder or file in a different file system. 
These can be created in the following way on Linux and Mac operating systems.

what is hard link in linux?
=======================
Every file on the Linux filesystem starts with a single hard link. The link is between the filename and the actual data stored on the filesystem

what is hardening in linux?
========================
What is OS Hardening? Operating system (OS) hardening, a type of system hardening, is the process of implementing security measures and patching for operating systems, such as Windows, Linux, or Apple OS X, with the objective of protecting sensitive computing systems.

what is the difference between grep and find?
=====================================
The main difference between the two is that grep is used to search for a particular string in a file whereas find is used to locate files in a directory, etc. also you might want to check out the two commands by typing 'man find' and 'man grep'

what is the Linux Volumes
============================
A physical volume will be seen as /dev/sda, /dev/sdb; a physical disk that is detected by Linux. 
If we have two physical disks of 1TB each, we can create a volume group of almost 2TB amongst the two. From the volume group, we can create three logical volumes each of any-size not exceeding the total volume group size

What is the use of LVM in Linux?
==============================
LVM is used for the following purposes: Creating single logical volumes of multiple physical volumes or entire hard disks (somewhat similar to RAID 0, but more similar to JBOD), allowing for dynamic volume resizing.

what is the diffrence between centos & Ubuntu
========================================
https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+the+difference+between+centos+and+ubuntu&sxsrf=ALiCzsYDtdhgVqbmPVL1ZxcAJhNWc0_oZA:1668047189762&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjdkduByKL7AhUDSmwGHUF9BLcQ_AUoAnoECAEQBA&biw=1422&bih=641&dpr=1.35#imgrc=yYhEibw6OM0I9M


FileSystem Management:
=======================
Linux plays a crucial role in full filling the system managemnet 
2 types
 1. folder
 2. filesystem - part c. d - LVM - Logical volume management

working with Filesystem:
===========================
2 types of approaches
 1. standard partition
 2. Logical Volume Management - LVM

standard partition:
=========================

i have 1000GB Disk 
250 GB

 3 Types 
 1. Primary Partition(P)
 2. Extended Partition(E)
 3. Logial Partition(L)

2. Logical Volume Management - LVM
===========================
